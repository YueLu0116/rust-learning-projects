# A simple Kindle mate

This project is a simple command line tool. It can parse "My Clippings.txt" in Kindle to markdown format for further use (write reading notes and books review). It will be simple and crude, because it is used for practicing Rust and I don't have enough time to "polish" it. 

Motivated by a free software [Kindle Mate](https://kmate.me). Easy to use, but Windows only and has not been updated since 2017.

## Features

- [ ] Detect whether Kindle is connected by USB

- [ ] Make statistical reading data (titles of books, writers, reading times...)

- [ ] Convert "My Clippings.txt" into markdown format. Example:

  ```markdown
  # Title of Books-by Author
  ![image of the book](xxxx)
  
  ## Notes
  Location, Time
  > Some excerpts
  My reviews, thoughts...
