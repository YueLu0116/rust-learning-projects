Obama convened his National Security Council. Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen, and White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley argued strongly against military intervention. 
In Tough Love , her recent memoir, Susan Rice, then ambassador to the United Nations and later National Security Adviser, writes that this group of experienced hands protested that “Libya was not our fight and, effectively, that the likely costs of letting Gaddafi take Benghazi…were acceptable when compared with the risks.”
 Rice had been at the National Security Council during the Rwandan genocide, which haunted her. When her turn to speak came, she cited that example and supported action. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also urged military intervention, as did Biden's national security adviser, Tony Blinken, and Ben Rhodes, Obama's communications adviser. 
Obama solicited Power's views, and she concurred, warning him that “Qaddafi's siege of Benghazi was sure to be savage.”
